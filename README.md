[**`bayesian`**](https://hsbadr.github.io/bayesian/) supports Bayesian
modeling using
[`brms`](https://paul-buerkner.github.io/brms/)/[`Stan`](https://mc-stan.org/)
with
[`parsnip`](https://parsnip.tidymodels.org/)/[`tidymodels`](https://www.tidymodels.org/).

Installation

Example
-------

    library(bayesian)

    bayesian_mod <-
      bayesian() %>%
      set_engine("brms") %>%
      fit(
        rating ~ treat + period + carry + (1 | subject),
        data = inhaler
      )
