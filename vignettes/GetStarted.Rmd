As a simple example, we will model the seizure counts in epileptic patients to
investigate whether the treatment (represented by variable `Trt`) can reduce the
seizure counts and whether the effect of the treatment varies with the baseline
number of seizures a person had before treatment (variable `Base`) and with the
age of the person (variable `Age)`. As we have multiple observations per `person`,
a group-level intercept is incorporated to account for the resulting dependency
in the data. In a first step, we use the `recipes` package to prepare (a recipe
for) the `epilepsy` data. This data set is shipped with the `brms` package,
which is automatically loaded by `bayesian`.

```{r}
epi_recipe <- epilepsy |>
  recipe() |>
  update_role(count, new_role = "outcome") |>
  update_role(Trt, Age, Base, patient, new_role = "predictor") |>
  add_role(patient, new_role = "group") |>
  step_normalize(Age, Base)
```

```{r}
print(epi_recipe)
```

Above, we not only define the roles of the relevant variables but also
normalized the `Age` and `Base` predictors to facilitate model fitting later
on. In the next step, we use `bayesian` to set up a basic model structure.

```{r}
epi_model <- bayesian(
    family = poisson()
  ) |>
  set_engine("brms") |>
  set_mode("regression")
```

```{r}
print(epi_model)
```

The `bayesian` function is the main function of the package to initialize a
Bayesian model. We can set up a lot of the information directly within the
function or update the information later on, via the `update` method. For
example, if we didn't specify the family initially or set it to something else
that we now wanted to change, we could use the `update` method as follows

```{r}
epi_model <- epi_model |>
  update(family = poisson())
```

Next, we define a workflow via the `workflows` package, by combining the above
defined data processing recipe and the model plus the actual model formula to be
passed to the `brms` engine.

```{r}
epi_workflow <- workflow() |>
  add_recipe(epi_recipe) |>
  add_model(
    spec = epi_model,
    formula = count ~ Trt + Base + Age + (1 | patient)
  )
```

```{r}
print(epi_workflow)
```

We are now ready to fit the model by calling the `fit` method
with the data set we want to train the model on.

```{r results='hide', echo = FALSE}
run_on_linux <- grepl("linux", R.Version()$os, ignore.case = TRUE)
```

```{r results='hide', eval = run_on_linux}
epi_workflow_fit <- epi_workflow |>
  fit(data = epilepsy)
```

```{r eval = run_on_linux}
print(epi_workflow_fit)
```

To extract the parsnip model fit from the workflow

```{r eval = run_on_linux}
epi_fit <- epi_workflow_fit |>
  extract_fit_parsnip()
```

The `brmsfit` object can be extracted as follows

```{r eval = run_on_linux}
epi_brmsfit <- epi_workflow_fit |>
  extract_fit_engine()
```

```{r eval = run_on_linux}
class(epi_brmsfit)
```

We can use the trained workflow, which includes the fitted model, to
conveniently `predict` using new data without having to worry about all
the data reprocessing, which is automatically applied using the workflow
preprocessor (recipe).

```{r}
newdata <- epilepsy[1:5, ]
```

```{r eval = run_on_linux}
epi_workflow_fit |>
  predict(
    new_data = newdata,
    type = "conf_int",
    level = 0.95
  )
```

To add the standard errors on the scale of the linear predictors

```{r eval = run_on_linux}
epi_workflow_fit |>
  predict(
    new_data = newdata,
    type = "conf_int",
    level = 0.95,
    std_error = TRUE
  )
```
