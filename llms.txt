[**`bayesian`**](https://hsbadr.github.io/bayesian/) supports Bayesian
modeling using
[`brms`](https://paul-buerkner.github.io/brms/)/[`Stan`](https://mc-stan.org/)
with
[`parsnip`](https://parsnip.tidymodels.org/)/[`tidymodels`](https://www.tidymodels.org/).

## Installation

The stable version of [`bayesian`](https://hsbadr.github.io/bayesian/)
can be installed from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=bayesian) using:

``` r
install.packages("bayesian")
```

The development version of
[`bayesian`](https://hsbadr.github.io/bayesian/) can be installed from
[GitHub](https://github.com/hsbadr/bayesian) using:

``` r
install.packages("pak")
pak::pkg_install("hsbadr/bayesian")
```

## Example

``` r
library(bayesian)

bayesian_mod <-
  bayesian() |>
  set_engine("brms") |>
  fit(
    rating ~ treat + period + carry + (1 | subject),
    data = inhaler
  )

summary(bayesian_mod$fit)
```
